Start of Project: 2-Aug-2025 10:00 PM PH TIME

This is my first ever project in Web Development. I'll be putting my favorite recipes here for the content of this website.

MY GOALS:  
    - I will learn more about HTML.  
    - I will design this website using CSS.  
    - I will learn Java as well.  

As of 2-Aug-2025: I don't know what to do and I hardly remember the syntax of HTML. <br/>
As of 19-Oct-2025: Got a new job and don't have enough spare time. Good to be back.
